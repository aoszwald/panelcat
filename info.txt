To create a new panel file, choose a tab-delimited target region file. 
Optionally, specify a row number to start reading the file and skip additional headers. 
If the first three columns do not correspond to "chromosome, start, stop coordinates" of the regions, specify the columns containing chromosome, start, end coordinates (e.g. "1,2,3" without ""). 
Use the same approach for an optional mask file. 
Panel files can be stored by download after analysis is complete and uploaded again at a later time.

"RefSeq" refers to the exon base coverage of the panels. 
"ClinVar" refers to the targeted variants listed in ClinVar.
"COSMIC" refers to the targeted mutations listed in the COSMIC CMC data.

For the Panel analysis and the graphical output, only "pathogenic"/"likely pathogenic" Variants in Clinvar are used, and Tier 1-3 oncogenic mutations in Cosmic CMC.
The "Clinvar" and "COSMIC" tabs show all variants / mutations listed in the databases that are targeted by the panel, regardless of clinical significance.
